 *
 * \todo The current buffer management system assumes too much and is severily
 * limited:
 * - It expects to all buffers to be used by clients, and has little provisions
 *   for private buffers (such as ring buffers, primary DMA buffers, etc.) This
 *   is currently overcomed by allocating these buffers directly in AGP memory
 *   when available, or by allocating a pool with a single buffer and with a
 *   size different of the regular client buffers.
 * - It doesn't allow to be two different pools with the same log2 of the
 *   buffers size making impossible, e.g., to have to pools of buffers: one
 *   private and one public.
 * - The high/low water mark is hardly used and the freelist should be
 *   redesigned to be more useful for all drivers.
